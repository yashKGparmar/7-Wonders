      <h2>History Of Taj Mahel</h2>
      <p>
        <em
          >The Taj Mahal of Agra is one of the Seven Wonders of the World, for
          reasons more than just looking magnificent. It's the history of Taj
          Mahal that adds a soul to its magnificence: a soul that is filled with
          love, loss, remorse, and love again. Because if it was not for love,
          the world would have been robbed of a fine example upon which people
          base their relationships. An example of how deeply a man loved his
          wife, that even after she remained but a memory, he made sure that
          this memory would never fade away. This man was the Mughal Emperor
          Shah Jahan, who was head-over-heels in love with Mumtaz Mahal, his
          dear wife. She was a Muslim Persian princess (her name Arjumand Banu
          Begum before marriage) and he was the son of the Mughal Emperor
          Jehangir and grandson of Akbar the Great. It was at the age of 14 that
          he met Mumtaz and fell in love with her. Five years later in the year
          1612, they got married. <br /><br />

          Mumtaz Mahal, an inseparable companion of Shah Jahan, died in 1631,
          while giving birth to their 14th child. It was in the memory of his
          beloved wife that Shah Jahan built a magnificent monument as a tribute
          to her, which we today know as the "Taj Mahal". The construction of
          Taj Mahal started in the year 1631. Masons, stonecutters, inlayers,
          carvers, painters, calligraphers, dome-builders and other artisans
          were requisitioned from the whole of the empire and also from Central
          Asia and Iran, and it took approximately 22 years to build what we see
          today. An epitome of love, it made use of the services of 22,000
          laborers and 1,000 elephants. The monument was built entirely out of
          white marble, which was brought in from all over India and central
          Asia. After an expenditure of approximately 32 million rupees, Taj
          Mahal was finally completed in the year 1653. <br /><br />

          It was soon after the completion of Taj Mahal that Shah Jahan was
          deposed by his own son Aurangzeb and was put under house arrest at
          nearby Agra Fort. Shah Jahan, himself also, lies entombed in this
          mausoleum along with his wife. Moving further down the history, it was
          at the end of the 19th century that British Viceroy Lord Curzon
          ordered a sweeping restoration project, which was completed in 1908,
          as a measure to restore what was lost during the Indian rebellion of
          1857: Taj being blemished by British soldiers and government officials
          who also deprived the monument of its immaculate beauty by chiseling
          out precious stones and lapis lazuli from its walls. Also, the British
          style lawns that we see today adding on to the beauty of Taj were
          remodeled around the same time. Despite prevailing controversies, past
          and present threats from Indo-Pak war and environmental pollution,
          this epitome of love continuous to shine and attract people from all
          over the world. <br /><br />

            square miles (10 square km) in south-central Yucatán state, Mexico.
            It is thought to have been a religious, military, political, and
            commercial centre that at its peak would have been home to 35,000
            people. The site first saw settlers in 550, probably drawn there
            because of the easy access to water in the region via caves and
            sinkholes in limestone formations, known as cenotes. Learn about the

            Chichén Itzá is located some 90 miles (150 km) east-northeast of
            Uxmal and 75 miles (120 km) east-southeast of the modern city of
            Mérida. The only source of water in the arid region around the site
            is from the cenotes. Two big cenotes on the site made it a suitable
            place for the city and gave it its name, from chi (“mouths”), chen
            (“wells”), and Itzá, the name of the Maya tribe that settled there.
            Chichén Itzá was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1988.

        <em
          >Petra is an iconic ancient site in southern Jordan. A secret to all
          but the Bedouins until 1812, Petra's incredible monuments are now
          considered to be one of the wonders of the world.</em

      <h3>Histroy About Petra</h3>
      <p>
        <em
          >Petra was established by the once nomadic Kingdom of the Nabataeans.
          Carving a city out of the sandstone rocks and cliffs, the Nabataeans
          settled and made Petra into their capital. The Nabataeans chose this
          site carefully, selecting a place which was located along the paths of
          numerous strategic caravan trails. <br /><br />

          It is unknown when Petra was first founded, but it was inhabited from
          prehistoric times and fully established by the fourth century BC, by
          which time it had achieved fame as an incredible feat of architecture.
          In 312 BC, Petra was attacked in by Antigonus I Monophthalmos, who had
          once been a general of Alexander the Great, although he failed to
          capture it. <br /><br />

          Petra continued to thrive under the Nabataeans, growing into a centre
          of trade with around 300,000 citizens and becoming extremely
          prosperous. It managed to resist numerous invasions and conquests,
          including by the Hasmonean Jewish Commonwealth and by the Romans.
          However, in 106 AD, during the reign of the Roman emperor Trajan,
          Petra lost its independence as it was absorbed into the Roman Arabian
          territory. <br /><br />

          Petra maintained its status as an important trading centre throughout
          its time under the Roman Empire. It was only as the empire fell and
          following a series of earthquakes that Petra declined, at one point
          being a Crusader stronghold, but eventually forgotten. <br /><br

        <h3>Histroy About Machhu Pichhu</h3>
        <p>
          <em
            >Machu Picchu is a 15th-century Inca site located on a ridge between
            the Huayna Picchu and Machu Picchu mountains in Peru. It sits 7,970
            feet (2,430 meters) above sea level on the eastern slope of the
            Andes and overlooks the Urubamba River hundreds of feet below.
            <br /><br />

            The site's excellent preservation, the quality of its architecture,
            and the breathtaking mountain vista it occupies has made Machu
            Picchu one of the most famous archaeological sites in the world
            today. The site covers 80,000 acres (32,500 hectares). Terraced
            fields on the edge of the site were once used for growing crops,
            likely maize and potatoes. <br /><br />

            In 1911, explorer Hiram Bingham III, a professor at Yale University,
            visited the site and published its existence for the first time. He
            found it covered with vegetation, much of which has now been
            removed. The buildings were made without mortar (typical of the
            Inca), their granite stones quarried and precisely cut. <br /><br />
            When Bingham discovered the site he was actually searching for
            Vilcabamba, the last capital of the Inca before their final defeat
            at the hands of the Spanish in 1572. <br /><br />

        <h3>Histroy About Chriest Redeemer</h3>
        <p>
          <em
            >It is in the XVIth century that begins the history of the redeeming
            Christ of Rio. At that time the Portuguese, who dominated the
            Brazilian territory, gave the name of "pinnacle of temptation" to a
            strange mountain located near the Atlantic coast in Rio de Janeiro.
            This name is a reference found in the Bible. A century later this
            mountain will be renamed Corcovado, a name deriving from the word
            "Bosse" which was given to him by its general form similar to the
            back of a hunchback. <br /><br />

            Surrounded by a dense forest and with steep relief, this mountain
            was not accessible. It was not until 1824 that a path was opened to
            reach its summit, which was to be widened rapidly on the way.
            <br /><br />

            But the idea of the construction of a monument religion at its
            summit dates much later, in 1859. That year there arrived on the
            spot Father Pedro Maria Boss, a lazarist. He was overwhelmed by the
            beauty of the site and decided to meet the queen of Brazil Isabella
            to ask for the necessary funds for the construction of this
            monument. The meeting actually took place that year, but it was not
            followed up. The project was abandoned and the idea lost.
            <br /><br />

            But the Corcovado, now accessible, attracted people. A railroad was
            decided in the 1880s, built in the wake and inaugurated on October
            9, 1884. Starting from Cosme Velho station, the line measured (and
            still measures, by the way) 3824m and climbs to the top of the
            Corcovado in a series of laces and twenty minutes. It was Emperor
            Peter II of Brazil himself who inaugurated it. Pierre II of Brazil
            will be seen a few years later at the inauguration of the Eiffel
            Tower. This railway was not only a technical challenge, it was also
            a symbolic challenge insofar as the Corcovado was nothing but a peak
            at the time, the railway had no purpose of tourism. Developing
            tourism at the end of the nineteenth century was truly an innovative
            idea, since the economic strength of a country was at that time
            rather oriented towards heavy industry or agriculture.
            <br /><br />
            A few years later, in 1922, Brazil was to celebrate its centenary.
            It must be known that at that time it was very common to celebrate
            the anniversaries of independence by building a statue, a monument,
            most of the time that have passed through time. For example, the
            Statue of Liberty in New York was offered to the United States by
            France for the centenary of its independence. Similarly, the Eiffel
            Tower in Paris was built for the Universal Exhibition of 1889, the
            year of the centenary of the independence of France. Brazil wanted
            to have its monument commemorating the centenary of independence.
            The previous year, in 1921, a project was decided, and Brazil being
            a religious country, he accepted the proposal of the Church to erect
            a bronze statue at the top of the Sugar Loaf. But this decision was
            discussed, it did not suit everyone, because even before the
            republic of Brazil was official the separation of the Church and the
            State was already established. It was therefore astonishing that
            Brazil, a secular country in essence, approves of a purely religious
            project, but it is simply the strength of the Church that it has
            achieved its ends. Two other sites were chosen: Corcovado and Santo
            Antonio. It was the Corcovado which was chosen because it was
            higher, quite simply. <br /><br />

            A call for competition is launched and in 1923 the winner is
            informed that he was chosen in September of this year. It is the
            project of the Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, the latter
            being a personality of the time. This project was that of a gigantic
            statue of Christ bearing a cross which he clasped against his body
            with the help of his hand, his other hand holding a celestial globe.
            He made drawings and launched the project of construction,
            estimating cost, time, and especially method of construction.
            Unfortunately, the project never really started, both because of the
            funding that was struggling to arrive and the insoluble technical
            constraints. The first stone was laid down, but on principle.

        <h3>History About Colosseum</h3>
        <p>
          <em
            >The floor of the colosseum, where you might expect to see a smooth
            ellipse of sand, is instead a bewildering array of masonry walls
            shaped in concentric rings, whorls and chambers, like a huge
            thumbprint. The confusion is compounded as you descend a long
            stairway at the eastern end of the stadium and enter ruins that were
            hidden beneath a wooden floor during the nearly five centuries the
            arena was in use, beginning with its inauguration in A.D. 80. Weeds
            grow waist-high between flagstones; caper and fig trees sprout from
            dank walls, which are a patchwork of travertine slabs, tufa blocks
            and brickwork. The walls and the floor bear numerous slots, grooves
            and abrasions, obviously made with great care, but for purposes that
            you can only guess. <br /><br />

            The guesswork ends when you meet Heinz-Jürgen Beste of the German
            Archaeological Institute in Rome, the leading authority on the
            hypogeum, the extraordinary, long-neglected ruins beneath the
            Colosseum floor. Beste has spent much of the past 14 years
            deciphering the hypogeum—from the Greek word for “underground”—and
            this past September I stood with him in the heart of the great
            labyrinth. “See where a semicircular slice has been chipped out of
            the wall?” he said, resting a hand on the brickwork. The groove, he
            added, created room for the four arms of a cross-shaped, vertical
            winch called a capstan, which men would push as they walked in a
            circle. The capstan post rested in a hole that Beste indicated with
            his toe. “A team of workmen at the capstan could raise a cage with a
            bear, leopard or lion inside into position just below the level of
            the arena. Nothing bigger than a lion would have fit.” He pointed
            out a diagonal slot angling down from the top of the wall to where
            the cage would have hung. “A wooden ramp slid into that slot,
            allowing the animal to climb from the cage straight into the arena,”
            he said. Just then, a workman walked above our heads, across a
            section of the arena floor that Colosseum officials reconstructed a
            decade ago to give some sense of how the stadium looked in its
            heyday, when gladiators fought to their death for the public’s
            entertainment. The footfalls were surprisingly loud. Beste glanced
            up, then smiled. “Can you imagine how a few elephants must have
            sounded?” Today, many people can imagine this for themselves.
            Following a $1.4 million renovation project, the hypogeum was opened
            to the public this past October. Trained as an architect
            specializing in historic buildings and knowledgeable about Greek and
            Roman archaeology, Beste might be best described as a forensic
            engineer. Reconstructing the complex machinery that once existed
            under the Colosseum floor by examining the hypogeum's skeletal
            remains, he has demonstrated the system's creativity and precision,
            as well as its central role in the grandiose spectacles of imperial
            Rome. When Beste and a team of German and Italian archaeolgists
            first began exploring the hypogeum, in 1996, he was baffled by the
            intricacy and sheer size of its structures: “I understood why this
            site had never been properly analyzed before then. Its complexity
            was downright horrifying.” The disarray reflected some 1,500 years
            of neglect and haphazard construction projects, layered one upon
            another. After the last gladiatorial spectacles were held in the
            sixth century, Romans quarried stones from the Colosseum, which
            slowly succumbed to earthquakes and gravity. Down through the
            centuries, people filled the hypogeum with dirt and rubble, planted
            vegetable gardens, stored hay and dumped animal dung. In the
            amphitheater above, the enormous vaulted passages sheltered
            cobblers, blacksmiths, priests, glue-makers and money-changers, not
            to mention a fortress of the Frangipane, 12th-century warlords. By
            then, local legends and pilgrim guidebooks described the crumbling
            ring of the amphitheater's walls as a former temple to the sun.
            Necromancers went there at night to summon demons. <br /><br />

            >The Great Wall of China is the world's largest military defense
            structure. It towers and meanders along mountain ranges, constructed
            more than 2,000 years ago. It was made more brilliant by the
            numerous wars, power struggles, successive dynasties, political and
            economic historical events influencing imperial China for over 2,000
            years. <br /><br />

            The everlasting value of the Great Wall comes from the architecture,
            with its components of the wall, gates, towns, garrisons, and signal
            towers, along with their artistic elements. It also derives fame
            from the countless classical works of poetry, folk literature,
            theater and storytelling written about it by rulers, soldiers,
            literati and famous poets. <br /><br />

            This book is among the most systematic and comprehensive works on
            the Great Wall. It conveys to the reader content in language that is
            clear and straightforward. It traces the history of the Great Wall's
            origin, including the initial Period of construction for multiple
            defensive walls, the era of overall transformation, the Period of
            the partial expansion and the Period of overall maintenance. The
            readers will obtain a clear and comprehensive view of the overall
            picture of the Great Wall and its history from this book.</em
